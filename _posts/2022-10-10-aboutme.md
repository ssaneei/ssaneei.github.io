Hey! I'm Sarah :) I'm currently PhD candidate in Computational Linguistics in <a href ="https://www.unige.ch"> Unige </a> in CLCL lab, working partially as an assistant in Computational Neuroscience in NDLab, as well.

I became a fan of Linguistics since my English teacher talked about Etymology with us, when I was 9 years old. As working with Computer and solving mathematic -specially algebraic- problems were interesting to me, I filled my spare time -as a teenager- learning some more about them. After finishing school, I decided to choose a major which has a conflation of them and Computer Science was the best choice of mine. Studying Automata, Neural Networks, Artificial Intelligence, Numeral Analysis and courses in Algebra amused me and I was into courses such as Digital Design, Algorithm (ref book CLRS), Computer Architecture and Software Engineering. 

Meanwhile, I was studying French Language in Tehran University Institute and I felt that I seek more of French, its literature and grammar, so after finishing my B.Sc. in Computer Science- with heart full of joy about it-I followed my second love: French. 
After 4 years of B.A. in French Translation, one of my sincere professor suggested me to search about Computational Linguistics which made me super grateful, finding a major that has merged my interests. 

So I started studying Computational Linguistics -also known as Linguistics Engineering- in Sharif University of Technology. Extremely interested in Deep Learning as well as Syntax, I finished my master being the top rank student. 
Seeking for a position for doctorate in my discipline I applied and got accepted in many universities but I chose Geneva :) and to fill the remaining time till my PhD begins, I worked as an intern at Campus Biotech in Computational Neuroscience for about 6 months, the opportunity can never forget about.

I started my Phd position in the University of Geneva in CLCL lab since November 2021. :) 
As of my second bachelor, I get to know about neuroscience and the BCI, and working in Machine Learning, I found that I have an interest in studying brain functioning so I began a part time research assistant position in NDLab in Computational Neuroscience of Unige in September 2022.
