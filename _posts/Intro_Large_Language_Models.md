tags: [Summaries]

<p>Hello! 
I am back from my holidays in South Africa!! AND it is my first day at work! <3
Today, I came across with this video by Andrej Karpathy. In this video, he is trying to introduce LLMs. The talk is for about an hour and in the end of it, you will have a good understanding of these models. <p>
<ul>
  <li>He starts with Llama 2 70B to define LLMs to a busy person! So you won't need any pre-requisits.</li>
  <li>He continues with what a neural network is doing: predicting the next word in the sequence.</li>
  <li>Here I will list the sentenses that he uses that is interesting to me:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><i>There is a very close relation between prediction and compression.</i></li>
      <li>Next word prediction forces the neural network to learn a lot about the world.</li>
      <li></li>
      
    </ul>
    
  <li></li>
