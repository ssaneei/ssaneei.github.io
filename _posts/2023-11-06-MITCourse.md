<p>Hey there! Today I got to know about this new course in Matrix Calculus! It's definitely not to miss!</p>
<p>You can find the courses here: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-s096-matrix-calculus-for-machine-learning-and-beyond-january-iap-2023/download/ </p>
<p>Some of the topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Derivatives as linear operators and linear approximation on arbitrary vector spaces: beyond gradients and Jacobians.</li>
  <li>Derivatives of functions with matrix inputs and/or outputs (e.g. matrix inverses and determinants). Kronecker products and matrix “vectorization.”</li>
  <li>Derivatives of matrix factorizations (e.g. eigenvalues/SVD) and derivatives with constraints (e.g. orthogonal matrices).</li>
  <li>Multidimensional chain rules, and the significance of right-to-left (“forward”) vs. left-to-right (“reverse”) composition. Chain rules on computational graphs (e.g. neural networks).</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>
