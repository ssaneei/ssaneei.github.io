title: Summaries on Inception Loop article
tags: [Summaries]
---

<p>Hey there! Today I want to write a bit about the article I want to work on these days. The name is "Inception loops discover what excites neurons most using deep predictive models".
As I'm not that expert in the Neuroscience field, the explanations could be sometimes basic or redundant. ;) </p>

<p>So the main goal in this article is to dissect the neural mechanism of sensation and so they want to find stimuli that optimally drive neurons.</p>
