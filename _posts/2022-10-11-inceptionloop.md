title: Summaries on Inception Loop article
tags: [Summaries]

<p>Hey there! Today I want to write a bit about the article I want to work on these days. The name is "Inception loops discover what excites neurons most using deep predictive models".
As I'm not that expert in the Neuroscience field, the explanations could be sometimes basic or redundant and sometimes more than the article itself. :)) </p>

<p>So the main goal in this article is to dissect the neural mechanism of sensation and to understand the information processing in the brain, they want to find the stimuli that optimally drive neurons.</p>
<p>In linear systems, linear filters elicit responses optimally. 
Linear Nonlinear (LN) Models with center-surround filters have high predictive power in the retina and drive its activity.</p>
what is center-surround filter?

<p>BUT the thing is the response selectivity of lots of cortical neurons is inherently nonlinear </p>
And even in V1, the predictive power of LNthe responses to natural stimuli 
In classical conditioning, a neutral stimulus is something that does not elicit a response.
