    <li>Features that are globally important may not be important in the local context, and vice versa.<br>Ribeiro, M. T., Singh, S., & Guestrin, C. (2016, August). " Why should i trust you?"

    <li>A common hypothesis is that representations collapse irrelevant differences in images (e.g. illumination or viewpoint), so that Î¦ should not be uniquely invertible. Hence, we pose this as a reconstruction problem and find a number of possible reconstructions rather than a single one. By doing so, we obtain insights into the invariances captured by the representation.
